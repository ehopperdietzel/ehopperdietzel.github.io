                        <p class="justify">Eduardo is a computer science civil engineer who graduated in 2022 from Universidad Austral de Chile. Currently, he resides in a small town called Puyuhuapi, surrounded by nature in the remote corners of the Chilean Patagonia. He loves art and creating, therefore, he sees software development as a way to express his creativity. He dreams of creating his own free operating system with a user-friendly experience and software tools that allow everyone to unleash their creativity. Consequently, he has created Cuarzo, an organization dedicated to the development of free and open-source software. Recently, he has developed an interest in the world of graphics on Linux and has dedicated a significant portion of his time to developing Louvre, a C++ library designed to facilitate the creation of Wayland compositors (display servers), among other tools.</p>

                            <p class="justify">During my university internship, I developed a mobile app using Expo/React Native and a REST API with PHP for Ito-e, a company specializing in providing services to construction companies for efficient project management and tracking. The application empowers Ito-e users to oversee project progress and conduct on-site inspections, allowing for organization by projects, typologies, batches, and more. Users, with different roles and permissions, can perform inspections in both online and offline modes. They can capture notes, photos, GPS location data, and other relevant information and can accept or reject completion indications provided by other users.
                                The development posed a significant challenge due to the vast and intricate database and resource-intensive operations required for measuring project progress and implementing complex search filters. To address this challenge, I devised a solution for offline functionality, implementing a method to compress and simplify project information and images, storing them in a local database using SQLite. Additionally, I optimized and replicated the sophisticated server-side searches on mobile devices with limited processing power. Once an internet connection was restored, all locally captured data seamlessly synchronized with the server. The company managers were impressed with the outcome, considering my work at a senior level. They mentioned that due to the quality of the product, they felt confident in expanding their services to international clients.</p>

                            <p class="justify">I developed a 3D augmented reality mobile game using Unity for Unicorn Games, a company that combines tabletop games for children with technology. In this game, players engage in shooting at dynamic 3D targets that seemingly hover on the screen, seamlessly integrated with real-time images captured by the camera. This creates the illusion that the targets exist within the same room. The aiming mechanism involves utilizing the phone oscilloscope.
                                Simultaneously, I contributed to enhancing the visual effects of another augmented reality game within the company. This specific game, centered around Lego elements, manifested on the screen when kids directed the camera towards a game card.</p>

This application enables users to map body gestures captured by the camera to system events, allowing functionalities such as controlling the pointer or managing racing games using hand gestures.

                                Additionally, the website calculated the transportation cost for tutors to reach the students' homes.</p>

                            <p class="justify">I developed a desktop application using Qt and implemented a Python microservice for a freelance client. The project involved creating an application that allows users to select two directories—one to monitor for incoming files (from another local application) and another to receive the processed files from an external service.
                                Essentially, the local files were sent to a Python microservice, which added them to a RabbitMQ queue. Subsequently, the files were processed by an external service and sent back to the microservice as processed. The desktop application then fetched the microservice and stored the processed files in the second directory. Additionally, the desktop app displayed a table containing file information and the processing status.</p>

                            <p class="justify">The objective of this project was to determine if it is possible to predict the number of billionaires per country based on variables such as population size, GATT, and GDP by modeling the problem with a Poisson regression. The project involved finding the model weights using various optimization methods and analyzing the results using resampling techniques such as bootstrap.</p>

To achieve this, an analysis was conducted in the frequency spectrum using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), spectrograms, and various types of filters were then applied. Subsequently, the effectiveness of Finite Impulse Response (FIR) and Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters was compared.</p>

                            During the presentation, I delved into Louvre, a C++ library designed to streamline the development of Wayland compositors on Linux—an ongoing project that I continue to advance to this day.</p>
